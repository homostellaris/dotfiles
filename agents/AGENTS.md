# Testing

# Cypress

## E2E

Cypress tests should be organised such that they mirror the route they are testing. So in a NextJS application the route
`/blog/[slug]` would be tested by `cypress/e2e/blog/slug.cy.ts`.

# TypeScript

- Keep props types inline unless they need to be exported.

# Workflow

- **Strict Rule**: Never commit or push changes directly to default branches (`master`, `main`, `develop`) under any circumstances unless explicitly requested by the user in the current session. Always develop on a separate feature branch and raise a PR.

# Agent Skills

Common automation skills and artifact sharing are located under `agents/skills/`:
- **`share`**: Publish standalone HTML reports, visual plans, and multi-file task dashboards (`~/share/<spec_id>/`) using the Shadcn house style.
- **`symboldiff`**: Generate symbol-level code reviews with interactive visualization.
- **`commit-and-push`**: Co-author Git commits following Gitmoji standards.
- **`check-pr-run`**: Monitor and report GitHub Actions CI status.



# Agentic Build Orchestrator (`build`)

Automate full feature lifecycles from StarFocus spec to production with Antigravity and Herdr:
- **CLI Command**: `build <spec-id>` (e.g. `build canvas-section_y2vtpcom`)
- **Lifecycle**: Spec Discovery → Planner Agent → Tailscale Visual Plan (`share --task`) → Worktree Setup (`<repo>/.worktrees/<spec_id>`) → Implementer Agent → Local Test Gate (`bun test`) → Gitmoji Commit & PR → CI Monitoring → OpenClaw WhatsApp Alert → Verifier Agent Hardening → Post-Merge Deployment.
- **Herdr Integration**: Uses `herdr` for session management and interactive agent panes (`herdr session attach build-<spec-id>`).
- **Idempotency**: Pure external state evaluation (AGY transcripts, Git worktrees, tests, GitHub PRs) without requiring flags.
